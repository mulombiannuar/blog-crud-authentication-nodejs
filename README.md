# Building NodeJs Crud application with Authentication and MySQL

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a CRUD application using Node.js and MySQL and write some basic authentication and authorization. The application will connect to a MySQL database and allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Users will be able to register to the application using the signup page. It will also allow admin to manage users

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identification through the acquisition of credentials and using those credentials to confirm the user’s identity. The authorization process begins if the credentials are legitimate. The authorization process always follows the authentication procedure.

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of allowing authenticated users access to resources by determining whether they have system access permissions. By giving or denying specific licenses to an authenticated user, authorization enables you to control access privileges.
